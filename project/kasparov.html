            <h4>Board Representation</h4>

            <h5>Bitboard</h5>
            <p>A bitboard is used to represent the 
            current state of the chess board. Using a 64-bit number (<code>long</code> in Java, and
            ignoring the signed bit), each bit maps to a square on the 64-square board. 
            For example, in the <code>BoardStructure</code> class, bitboards are used to set the 
            locations of the pawns, and one is used for white, black, and both colored 
            pawns.</p>

            <h5>Fifty Move, En Passant, Castling</h5>
            <p>The fifty-move rule is a rule
            that a draw can be made if no capture has been made or no pawn has moved in the
            last fifty moves. In the <code>BoardStructure</code> class, we keep track of the fifty move
            with a counter <code>fiftyMove</code>, and whenever we make a move in the <code>MakeMove</code> class,
            if a non-capture, non-pawn move was made, <code>fiftyMove</code> gets incremented, 
            otherwise it is reset to zero. Note: a future improvement needs to be made 
            for the program to draw whenever the fifty-move rule can be invoked.</p>

            <p>En passant is a special pawn capture
            move. When a pawn makes a double-step move, an enemy pawn can capture it as if 
            it only advanced one square. It needs to be made immediately on the next move, 
            otherwise it is lost. The "en passant square" refers to the destination square
            itself to which the enemy pawn must move. In the <code>BoardStructure</code> class, we keep 
            track of the current active (if any) en passant square with <code>enPassant</code>. 
            Whenever we make a pawn start move (that is, when a pawn starts off at
            ranks 2 or 7), the <code>enPassant</code> square is set.</p>

            <p>Castling is a move that involves the
            king and the rook, where the king moves 2 squares towards the rook, and rook 
            "jumps" over the king. However, it is only available if neither the king nor
            the rooks have moved yet. In the <code>BoardStructure</code> class, we keep track of the 
            castling availability with <code>castlePerm</code>, which is an integer. The first bit 
            represents white's king side castling availability, the second bit represents
            white's queen side, the third bit represents black's king side, and the fourth
            bit represents blacks queen side. Note: a future improvement needs to be made
            so that it is only available if neither the king nor the rook has moved.</p>

            <h5>Move Generation</h5>
            <p>Move generation is
            the process of checking all legal moves from a given position of the chess 
            board, for a particular side to move. These moves are stored in a list, called
            the move list. Moves are represented with a 32-bit number. We generate the move
            list by iterating through every piece and determining all of its possible, valid
            destination squares on the board, that is, the destination square must be 
            empty and not offboard. The method of generating all of the move directions is
            with an array <code>pieceDirections</code> that maps each piece to an array of all of its
            directions.</p>

            <p>For example, with the knight we must check 8 positions:</p>
            
            <pre>
                8 . . . . . . . . 
                7 . . . . . . . . 
                6 . . . . . . . . 
                5 . . . x . x . . 
                4 . . x . . . x . 
                3 . . . . k . . . 
                2 . . x . . . x . 
                1 . . . x . x . . 
                    a b c d e f g h
            </pre>

            <p>This corresponds to the directions <code>{-8, -19, -21, -12,   8,  19,   21,  12}</code>.</p>

            <h5>Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN)</h5>
            <p>Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN)
            is a notation used to represent a particular position of the chess board. It is 
            in the format:
            
            <pre>
            X1/X2/X3/X4/X5/X6/X7/X8 &lt;side&gt; &lt;castling&gt; &lt;en passant square&gt; &lt;half moves&gt; &lt;full moves&gt;
            </pre>
            
            Each of <code>X1 .. X8</code> represent the ranks 8 to 1, and the contents of each square
            from files A to H are described for each rank. White pieces are represented as
            <code>p = pawn, n = knight, b = bishop, r = rook, q = queen, k = king</code>,
            and the black pieces are the same but uppercase. Consecutive empty squares are
            represented as numbers 1 to 8. Side represents the current side to move (either
            <code>w</code> for white or <code>b</code> for black). Castling represent current castling 
            availability (<code>K = white kingside, Q = white queenside, k = black kingside, q = black queen side</code>).
            The en passant square is represented in algebraic notation. The half move 
            counter counts the number of half moves made since the last capture or pawn
            move, and this is used to implement the fifty-move rule. The full move counter
            counts the total number of full moves made in the game.</p>

            <h5>Perft Testing</h5>
            <p>Perft testing (performance testing)
            is a method of rigorously testing the validity of the chess engine to 
            generate all legal moves for a specified depth, and counting the number of moves
            generated. If the count matches with the test suite expected results, then we
            can be fairly confident in the correctness of the program. We say <code>Perft(X)</code> to
            denote depth <code>X</code>.
            
            Perft testing is done with <code>PerftSuiteTest.java</code>, which runs the test suite 
            specified in <code>perft/perftsuite.txt</code>, which provides 126 positions in FEN, and 
            the expected number of moves generated for depths <code>Perft(1)</code> to <code>Perft(6)</code>.</p>

            <h4>Search and Move Ordering</h4>

            <h5>PV Table (Principal Variation Table)</h5>

            <p>Principle variation
            refers to the sequence of moves that the program considers the best next moves 
            to be played. During the iterative deepening loop, we need to consider the PV 
            during the current iteration. The approach in this program is to store the PV
            found during search as a <code>PVEntry</code>, which is stored in an array inside the 
            <code>PVTable</code>. 
            
            The <code>PVTable</code> works as a hash table, as we hash the board's <code>positionKey</code> as an 
            index into the array where we store the <code>PVEntry</code>. Similarly, to retrieve the 
            last <code>PVEntry</code> based on the current board <code>positionKey</code>, we hash the 
            <code>positionKey</code> to get an index to lookup in the array. The <code>PVTable</code> size is 
            fixed at <code>150000</code>, a reasonably large size to prevent hash collisions.</p>

            <h5>Most Valuable Victim Least Valuable Aggressor (MVVLVA)</h5>
            
            <p>Most Valuable Victim Least Valuable Aggressor (MVVLVA)
            is exactly what its name implies, and is a heuristic used for ordering capture
            moves. The principle is to use the least valuable piece on the current side to
            capture the most valuable piece on the opposing side. By order of most valuable
            to least valuable, excluding the king, we have: queen, rook, bishop, knight,
            pawn.</p>

            <h5>Iterative Deepening</h5>
            
            <p>Iterative deepening
            is a graph search strategy where depth-first search is done to a limited depth,
            and increasing depth limits each time until the search time has been exhausted.
            It combines the space efficiency of depth-first search with the "completeness"
            of breadth first search. This is implemented, along with alpha-beta search and 
            quiescence search, in the <code>Search</code> class.</p>
            
            <p>
            The approach in this program is that that we iterate from depths 1 to the 
            maximum depth (given by <code>searchEntry.getDepth()</code>), we run alpha-beta search 
            limited to that depth. This can be visualized as:</p>

            <pre>
                        1
                /       |       \
               2        2        2
             / | \    / | \    / | \
            3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
            </pre>
            
            <p>
            We search only up to depth 1 down the game tree on the first iteration, then up 
            to 2, then 3, and so on. Note that although we do repeat visits, such as if we 
            go to a depth of 3 repeating visiting nodes at depth 1 and 2 multiple times, it
            turns out that because the game tree grows exponentially, most of the nodes at
            at the leaves of the tree, so repeating visiting nodes at the top of the tree do 
            not majorly affect the overall search time.</p>

            <h5>Alpha-beta Pruning</h5>

            <p>Alpha-beta is an improvement over the minimax algorithm.</p>
        
            <p>We start off with minimax. Minimax
            is an algorithm to determine the score of the best move after a certain depth, 
            for zero-sum games. The main idea behind it is that one side's gain must 
            translate to the other side's loss, i.e. as we go down the game tree, at odd 
            depths we search for positions such that we maximize the score, and at even 
            depths we search for positions such that we minimize the score. However, to 
            minimize we can simply negate the maximizing score (this is also known as 
            negamax).</p>

            <p>The approach done in this program is to recursively call negamax, negating it
            each time until the base case, which is a depth of 0, where the 
            <code>PositionEvaluator</code> class is used to determine a score for that position. The 
            following provides brief pseudocode:</p>
        
            <pre>
            miniMaxSearch(int depth):
                if (depth == 0)
                    return PositionEvaluator.evaluatePosition()
                max = -inf
                moveList = MoveGenerator.generateAllMoves()
                for move in moveList:
                    score = -miniMaxSearch(depth - 1)
                    if (score > max):
                        max = score
                return max
            </pre>
            
            <p>
            Alpha-beta pruning is an
            algorithm that improves upon minimax in that it introduces two values, <code>alpha</code>
            and <code>beta</code>, which represent the current lower bound for the score for the 
            maximizing player and the current upper bound for the score against the 
            minimizing player, respectively. This value is nearly equivalent to the <code>max</code>
            in the minimax algorithm. However, as we go down the game tree, if we are at
            a stage in the algorithm such that in the next branch of the game tree, the 
            maximizer can do at least as well as the currently explored option (or vice 
            versa), then that branch can be eliminated entirely, because there would be no
            point exploring that branch since we already have a lower bound, and thus option
            worse should be ignored. This induces what is called a beta cutoff.
            </p>
            
            <pre>
            alphaBetaSearch(int alpha, int beta, int depth):
                if (depth == 0)
                    return PositionEvaluator.evaluatePosition()
                moveList = MoveGenerator.generateAllMoves()
                for move in moveList:
                    score = -alphaBetaSearch(alpha, beta, depth - 1)
                    if (score >= beta)
                        return beta
                    if (score > alpha):
                        alpha = score
                return alpha
            </pre>

            <h5>Quiescence Search</h5>

            <p>
            Quiescence search
            is used to lessen the effects of the horizon effect, where in the original 
            alpha-beta search as above evaluates the position, instead we perform an 
            additional search after. We search tactical exchanges (i.e. capture moves).
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The horizon effect is a problem
            that occurs due to the depth limitation of the search, where a detrimental move
            may not be able to be avoided because the program cannot search to the depth 
            of the error, i.e. a significant erroroneous move exists just beyond the search 
            depth of the program, but is not detected.
            </p>

            <p>
            The approach is that we first look at what is called standing pat, which is 
            essentially a lower bound on the score of if we do nothing, if it is at least 
            as good as alpha, then we return alpha. Then we generate all of the capture 
            moves, and continue searching from there, and then using <code>PositionEvaluator</code> 
            to evaluate the position.
            </p>

            <p>
            We can take advantage of the fact that generally, the amount of capture moves
            at any given position is relatively few, so the branching factor resulting from
            looking at further capture moves is low. Compared to if we were to increase the
            depth of alpha-beta instead, we would have been searching for potentially 
            hundreds of thousands more positions than a few hundred.

            <h5>UCI (Universal Chess Interface)</h5>

            <p>
            The Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is a common protocol used to 
            communicate with a GUI. The program can parse UCI <code>position</code> 
            and <code>go</code> commands:
            </p>
        
            <pre>
            position startpos [moves &lt;m1 m2 ... mn&gt;]
            </pre>

            <p>
            Sets up the board position to be the starting FEN position, with the option
            of initially making moves <code>m1 .. mn</code>.
            </p>

            <pre>
            position fen <fenString> [moves &lt;m1 m2 ... mn&gt;]
            </pre>

            <p>
            Sets up the board position to be specified FEN string (in double quotes), with
            the option of initially making moves <code>m1 .. mn</code>.
            </p>

            <pre>
            go [winc &lt;i&gt;] [binc &lt;i&gt;] [wtime &lt;t&gt;] [btime &lt;t&gt;] [movestogo &lt;m&gt;] [depth &lt;d&gt;]
            </pre>
            
            <p>
            Runs the search, with the given options. <code>winc</code> and <code>binc</code> refer to the white 
            and black increment per move in milliseconds, <code>wtime</code> and <code>btime</code> refer to the 
            time left given to white and black in milliseconds, <code>movetime</code> refers to the 
            maximum time allowed to make a move in milliseconds, <code>movestogo</code> refers to the 
            remaining number of moves to go, and <code>depth</code> refers to the maximum search depth.
            </p>
