  My name is Eric Liu, Im currently a third year student at the University of
  Waterloo, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Combinatorics &
  Optimization. My primary interests are in full stack web development and
  distributed systems.

  Im very passionate about self-teaching new concepts, working on interesting
  projects, collaborating in teams. I think that constantly learning and scanning
  for new developments in the realm of computer science is crucial to keeping
  up-to-date with current and future technologies.

  In my spare time, I work on a multitude of projects. My most recent ones have
  been:

  - Algorithm Helper, an online platform for students and developers to learn
  about algorithms, data structures, and other software engineering topics,
  built with the MERN stack and Elasticsearch
  - Kasparov Chess AI, a UCI compatible chess engine built in Java that
  incorporates bitboards, alpha-beta pruning and quiescence search
  - Wiki Graph Search, a platform built in Node using Wikipedia to generate
  courses as a low-cost educational resource alternative
  - tf-idf Text Summarizer, a JavaScript library for text summarization using
  tf-idf weighting
  - Alexa MD, an Amazon Alexa skill for diagnosing medical conditions through
  voice commands, winner of 2 awards at Hack Princeton

  Other times, I work on mini-projects and web experiments, which I use to test
  and keep myself in check with important concepts with algorithms,
  object-oriented, dynamic and functional programming.
