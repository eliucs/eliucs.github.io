My name is Eric Liu, I'm currently a third year student at the [University of
Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Combinatorics &
Optimization. My primary interests are in full stack web development and
distributed systems.

I'm very passionate about self-teaching new concepts, working on interesting
projects, and collaborating in teams. I think that constantly learning and scanning
for new developments in the realm of computer science is crucial to keeping
up-to-date with current and future technologies.

In my spare time, I work on a multitude of projects. My most recent ones have
been:

- [Algorithm Helper](https://www.algorithmhelper.com), an online platform for students and developers to learn
about algorithms, data structures, and other software engineering topics,
built with the MERN stack and Elasticsearch
- [Kasparov Chess AI](https://github.com/eliucs/kasparov-chess-ai), a UCI compatible chess engine built in Java that
incorporates bitboards, alpha-beta pruning and quiescence search
- [Wiki Graph Search](https://github.com/eliucs/wiki-graph-search), a platform built in Node using Wikipedia to generate
courses as a low-cost educational resource alternative
- [tf-idf Text Summarizer](https://github.com/eliucs/tf-idf-text-summarization), a JavaScript library for text summarization using
tf-idf weighting
- [Alexa MD](https://github.com/alexa-md), an Amazon Alexa app for diagnosing medical conditions through
voice commands, winner of 2 awards at Hack Princeton

Other times, I work on mini-projects and web experiments, which I use to test
and keep myself in check with important concepts with algorithms,
object-oriented, dynamic and functional programming.
