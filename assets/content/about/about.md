My name is Eric Liu, I'm a CS graduate (BCS) from the [University of
Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) (Class of 2021). Through the co-op program, I've had the
opportunity to do software engineering internships at [Instagram](https://instagram.com) in San
Francisco, CA, [Google](https://google.com) in Sunnyvale, CA, [Globality](https://globality.com) in
Menlo Park, CA, and [Tulip](https://tulip.co) in Boston, MA.

I currently work as a full-time software engineer at [Instagram](https://instagram.com) in San
Francisco, CA. My primary professional interests are in full-stack web development, modern web
infrastructure, and distributed systems. I'm really passionate about working on challenging projects
that help make people's lives easier!
