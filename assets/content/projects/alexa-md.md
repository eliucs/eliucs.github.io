Being able to give diagnoses quickly, efficiently and with disclosure of accuracy could mean the difference between preventing a serious disease and not making it to the doctor on time. alexaMD incorporates the use of the Amazon Alexa for the user to say their symptoms in a user-friendly manner, sends the symptom data to be processed by Watson's Natural Language Processing API and give back the user's most likely medical condition as well as the accuracy.

The web application works the same way, and is primarily used to demonstrate the power of the Watson API. The user enters their symptoms the same way they would tell Alexa, and the application gives their top 10 most likely symptoms and their associated accuracies, in a concise interface.
