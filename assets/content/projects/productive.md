Productive is a lightweight Chrome extension that makes your new tab page a beautiful, personal dashboard that helps you stay focused on your work. Featuring a modern, minimalistic user interface, you can add tasks, notes and shortcuts that are easily and conveniently accessible every time you open up your new tab page. You can track created, completed and deleted tasks, time spent productively versus time spent on social media and obtain an overview of your productivity with respect to your browsing habits.

By connecting to your email accounts, Productive is able to fetch your recent emails and give you fast access to them (NOTE: Currently only supports Gmail via the Gmail Extension). In addition, it displays your the time, date, location, current weather and five-day weather forecast. You have options to change the time from 12hr to 24hr clocks, and customize background photos.
